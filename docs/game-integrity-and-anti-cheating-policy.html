<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We are committed to maintaining a fair and enjoyable gaming environment for all players. This policy outlines our stance on cheating and the actions we will take to preserve game integrity.</p>
<h2>Definition of Cheating</h2>
<p>Cheating includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using third-party software to gain an unfair advantage.</li>
<li>Exploiting game bugs or glitches.</li>
<li>Manipulating game data or code.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Consequences of Cheating</h2>
<p>If a player is found to be cheating, the following actions will be taken:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Investigation</strong>: The player's account will be placed under investigation. During this time, the account may be temporarily suspended.</li>
<li><strong>Evidence Request</strong>: The player will be asked to provide evidence of their gameplay, such as video footage or a detailed explanation of their strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Permanent Suspension</strong>: If the player fails to provide satisfactory evidence within 72 hours, or if the evidence confirms cheating, the account suspension will become permanent.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Reporting Cheating</h2>
<p>If you suspect a player is cheating, please report it to our support team. Include as much detail as possible to aid our investigation.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We believe in a fair and balanced gaming experience for everyone. Cheating undermines this and will not be tolerated. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.</p>
