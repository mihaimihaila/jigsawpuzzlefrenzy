<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Do you love jigsaw puzzles? Do you enjoy challenging yourself and competing with other players? Do you want to win coins and gems while having fun? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you will love Puzzle of the Day!</p>
<h2>What is Puzzle of the Day?</h2>
<p>Puzzle of the Day is a special section of the game where you can play a free puzzle every day. The puzzle is randomly selected from our huge puzzle library, so you never know what you will get. It could be a beautiful landscape, a cute animal, a famous landmark, or anything else. The puzzle can be played in any difficulty mode, and you have to complete it as fast as you can. The faster you finish, the higher your score will be.</p>
<h2>Saving and Resuming Puzzle of the Day</h2>
<p>Puzzle of the Day can be saved and resumed while active. If you need to pause and return to your puzzle later, you can do so without losing your progress. However, please note that if you wish to resume a saved Puzzle of the Day after the active Puzzle of the Day has changed, you will need to either purchase the puzzle pack it belongs to or have a Premium Subscription.</p>
<h2>Competition and Rewards</h2>
<p>Puzzle of the Day is also a competition where you can compete with other players from around the world. You can see your rank and score on the leaderboard, and compare your performance with others. The top 10 players of the day will be rewarded with coins, which you can use to buy more puzzles, convert to gems, or unlock other features in the game.</p>
<h2>Using Gems</h2>
<p>Gems are a special game currency that you can use to play Puzzle of the Day. It costs only 1 gem to participate in Puzzle of the Day, and you can get gems by converting coins to gems or by purchasing gems with cash. You can also earn gems by completing achievements, watching ads, or inviting friends to play the game.</p>
<h2>Trial and Subscription</h2>
<p>Puzzle of the Day is a great way to test your skills, have fun, and win prizes. You can play Puzzle of the Day for only 1 gem every day for 3 months during the trial period. After the trial expires, you can continue playing Puzzle of the Day, but the participation cost will increase from 1 gem to 100 gems. This is to ensure that only the most dedicated and passionate players can enjoy this feature.</p>
<p>However, if you don't want to pay 100 gems per day, you can also choose to purchase a Premium subscription that grants you unlimited access to Puzzle of the Day along with many other benefits. With a Premium subscription, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove all ads from the game</li>
<li>Play puzzles with up to 400 pieces</li>
<li>Access the entire puzzle library of the game</li>
<li>Get exclusive puzzles and themes every month</li>
<li>Unlimited access to the daily puzzle</li>
</ul>
<h2>Premium Subscription Cost</h2>
<p>A Premium subscription costs only $14.99 per month (or $139.99 per year) and it includes a free 1 week trial. You can cancel anytime, and you will still have access to all the features until your subscription expires.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Try out Puzzle of the Day for free! You will love it!</p>
