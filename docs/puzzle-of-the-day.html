It could be a beautiful landscape, a cute animal, a famous landmark, or anything else. The puzzle can be played in any difficulty mode, and you have to complete it as fast as you can. The faster you finish, the higher your score will be.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. Puzzle of the Day is also a competition where you can compete with other players from around the world. You can see your rank and score on the leaderboard, and compare your performance with others. The top 10 players of the day will be rewarded with coins, which you can use to buy more puzzles, convert to gems, or unlock other features in the game.</p>
